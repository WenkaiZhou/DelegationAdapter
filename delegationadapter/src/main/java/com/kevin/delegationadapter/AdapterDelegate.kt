     * Called when a view created by this adapter has been recycled.
     *
     *
     *
     * A view is recycled when a [RecyclerView.LayoutManager] decides that it no longer
     * needs to be attached to its parent [RecyclerView]. This can be because it has
     * fallen out of visibility or a set of cached views represented by views still
     * attached to the parent RecyclerView. If an item view has large or expensive data
     * bound to it such as large bitmaps, this may be a good place to release those
     * resources.
     *
     *
     * RecyclerView calls this method right before clearing ViewHolder's internal data and
     * sending it to RecycledViewPool. This way, if ViewHolder was holding valid information
     * before being recycled, you can call [RecyclerView.ViewHolder.getAdapterPosition] to
     * get
     * its adapter position.
     *
     * @param holder The ViewHolder for the view being recycled
     */

    /**
     * Called by the RecyclerView if a ViewHolder created by this Adapter cannot be recycled
     * due to its transient state. Upon receiving this callback, Adapter can clear the
     * animation(s) that effect the View's transient state and return `true` so that
     * the View can be recycled. Keep in mind that the View in question is already removed from
     * the RecyclerView.
     *
     *
     * In some cases, it is acceptable to recycle a View although it has transient state. Most
     * of the time, this is a case where the transient state will be cleared in
     * [RecyclerView.Adapter.onBindViewHolder] call when View is
     * rebound to a new position.
     * For this reason, RecyclerView leaves the decision to the Adapter and uses the return
     * value of this method to decide whether the View should be recycled or not.
     *
     *
     * Note that when all animations are created by [RecyclerView.ItemAnimator], you
     * should never receive this callback because RecyclerView keeps those Views as children
     * until their animations are complete. This callback is useful when children of the item
     * views create animations which may not be easy to implement using an [ ].
     *
     *
     * You should *never* fix this issue by calling
     * `holder.itemView.setHasTransientState(false);` unless you've previously called
     * `holder.itemView.setHasTransientState(true);`. Each
     * `View.setHasTransientState(true)` call must be matched by a
     * `View.setHasTransientState(false)` call, otherwise, the state of the View
     * may become inconsistent. You should always prefer to end or cancel animations that are
     * triggering the transient state instead of handling it manually.
     *
     * @param holder The ViewHolder containing the View that could not be recycled due to its
     * transient state.
     * @return True if the View should be recycled, false otherwise. Note that if this method
     * returns `true`, RecyclerView *will ignore* the transient state of
     * the View and recycle it regardless. If this method returns `false`,
     * RecyclerView will check the View's transient state again before giving a final decision.
     * Default implementation returns false.
